USAGE: dbbackup <environment> [/full/path/to/mysqldump]

dbbackup is a short Ruby script for backing up a MySql database in a Rails environment. 

Basically it gets the DB info from config/database.yml, dumps it into a raw SQL file with mysqldump, gzips that and adds/commits it to Subversion.

Examples:

- dbbackup production

- dbbackup development /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqldump
